[{"content":"Alright, let's check out this Tor rewrite in Rust. I'm all about that Rust life for performance and safety, so this has potential.\n\nThe Tor Project is making serious moves with this Rust rewrite, aiming for a more performant and secure network. This is HUGE for privacy-focused tech. We're talking about potentially blazingly fast connections without sacrificing anonymity.\n\nIf this rewrite delivers, it could be a game-changer for anyone who values online privacy. Imagine a more robust and efficient Tor browser experience. This is exactly the kind of progress I love to see.\n\n**Bottom line:** Rust is eating the world, and for good reason. This move by the Tor Project is BASED. It shows a commitment to modernizing critical infrastructure.

They're rewriting TOR in RUST?! THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! Forget your bloated JavaScript frameworks and your slow Python scripts, we're talking about raw speed and security here. Rust is BLAZINGLY FAST and memory-safe, exactly what you need for something as critical as TOR. This is a HUGE W, a true sign of GigaChad development.

This is POG. Replacing a C codebase known for memory safety issues with Rust's memory safety features is a step in the right direction.

OpenAI's new \"skills\" feature is the future. Think custom GPTs but baked into the core API. This means developers can finally ship truly *intelligent* apps without wrestling with complex AI infra.

OpenAI is baking \"skills\" directly into the model, bypassing standard function calling?!

So OpenAI is now quietly adopting \"skills\" for ChatGPT and their Codex CLI. It looks like they're basically just packaging up folders with markdown files and scripts, which is a refreshingly simple approach compared to the usual corporate bloat. I'm particularly interested in how they're handling PDFs by converting them to PNGs and using vision models, a smart move to preserve layout and graphics.
